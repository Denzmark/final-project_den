Ingredients 
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup granulated sugar, plus 1/2 cup for rolling
1/2 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
Sprinkles, mini marshmallows, mini candies or dried fruit for filling</p>
<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>
<a>Whisk the flour, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, the cocoa powder, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Add the melted butter and eggs and stir until</a>
<a>combined. Cover and refrigerate the dough until firm, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Place the</a>
<a>confectioners' sugar and the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar in 2 separate small bowls. Roll scant tablespoonfuls of dough into balls; roll in the </a>
<a>granulated sugar and then in the confectioners' sugar. Place 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Lightly flatten each ball with your fingers and </a>
<a>make a deep 1/2-inch-wide indentation in the centers with your thumb. Place your choice of filling in the indentation. Bake the cookies until puffed and</a>
<a>slightly cracked, about 10 minutes. Let cool 3 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely.</h2></a></p>
