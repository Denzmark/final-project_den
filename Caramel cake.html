<h1>Instructions</h1>
Preheat the oven to 375째F. Lightly grease a 9" springform pan. 
Mix the crust ingredients till crumbly. Press onto the bottom and 1" up the sides of the prepared pan; prick with a fork. 
Bake the crust for 10 to 15 minutes, till light golden brown. Remove it from the oven; reduce oven temperature to 325째F. 
Mix the cream cheese, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, and flavor at low speed until smooth, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl. 
Add the eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl between additions. 
Stir in the caramel sauce and cream. 
Pour the filling into the crust and bake for 40 minutes. Reduce the heat to 300째F and bake 15 minutes more, until the edges of the cake are set, and an instant-read thermometer inserted 2" from the edge reads 170째F. 
Turn off the oven, crack the door, and let the cake cool in the oven for 1 hour. 
Remove the cake from the oven, and cool it at room temperature for 1 hour.
